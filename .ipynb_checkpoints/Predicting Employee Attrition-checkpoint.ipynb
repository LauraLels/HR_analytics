    "Employee turnover can be costly to a company: when an employee leaves (especially a seasoned employee), their expertise and their knowledge of the company leaves with them. The cost of recruiting and training a new employee while managing disruptions to the business due to the gap left behind can rack up. According to a <a href=\"https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/the-true-cost-of-staff-turnover-and-one-smart-way-to-reduce-it/\">Manulife study</a>, the cost of employee turnover is on average 40% of an employee's salary. The more skilled and specialized the employee is, the cost percentage increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can understand what causes employee turnover within a company and predict how likely an employee would leave, we can implement intervention strategies to reduce turnover. Thus, I am interested in the key factors impacting employee attrition and will build a predictive model for likelihood to attrite."
